# NYC_Taxi_Analysis

The problem statement of the NYC Taxi Data Analysis and Optimization project is to analyze the vast amount of taxi trip data from New York City
(NYC) and identify opportunities to optimize various aspects of the taxi system. This includes improving operational efficiency, enhancing service quality, and maximizing revenue for taxi drivers and companies.

Problem Statement:
What are the pickup and drop hotspots?
* Peak Hours to book a trip
* Average Passengers per trip
* Most Trip type within or intercity
* Toll Price
* Most busy days of a week
* Average Tip amount
* How distance change the price of the ride?

These are some the questions we need answer in order to increase revenue, manage the taxi availability and overall estimate the profit from each trip.
